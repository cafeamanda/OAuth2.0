# Step 7 - Protecting Pages

So now that you can log a user in and out of your website, let's use the logins to protect pages that we don't want anyone on the internet to be able to access.

We can verify that a user is logged in by checking to see if the login session has the username variable filled in. Since we populate it with each login and delete it upon each disconnect, if a username is not detected for a given request, let's redirect to the login page, prompting the user to go ahead and log in to continue. Like so:
```
@app.route('/restaurant/new/', methods=['GET','POST'])
def newRestaurant():
    if 'username' not in login_session:
        return redirect('/login')
    ...
```
Decide which pages should be visible to the public and which ones should be private for users. Go ahead and add this functionality where needed in your application. There are different places in the code where you can check to see if a user is logged in. But keep in mind how that impacts the user experience. For example, it would be kind of annoying to fill out a form only to find out that you can't submit it because you're not logged in.
