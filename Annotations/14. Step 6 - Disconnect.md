# Step 6 - Disconnect

Now, let's add some code to disconnect the user from the Google account, logging them out of our web application. This is done by telling the server to reject its access token.

Let's create another route and method, both called gdisconnect. I'll grab the credentials from my login object session again. If the credentials field is empty, we don't have record of a user, so there's no one to disconnect from the application and I'll return a 401 error for this case. Like so:
```
@app.route('/gdisconnect')
def gdisconnect():
    access_token = login_session.get('access_token')
    if access_token is None:
        print 'Access Token is None'
        response = make_response(json.dumps('Current user not connected.'), 401)
        response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
        return response
```
Now I will use the access token and pass it into Google's url for revoking tokens, like so:
```
    url = 'https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/revoke?token=%s' % login_session['access_token']
    h = httplib2.Http()
    result = h.request(url, 'GET')[0]
```
Then I store Google's response in an object called `result`.

If a response of `200` was received, then I successfully disconnected the users Google account from my application:
```
    if result['status'] == '200':
        del login_session['access_token']
        del login_session['gplus_id']
        del login_session['username']
        del login_session['email']
        del login_session['picture']
```
 Using the `del` command in Python, I delete the `credentials`, `gplus_id`, `username`, `email` and `picture` from my `login_session` object.

 Then, I create a response to indicate that a user was successfully logged out of my application:
 ```
         response = make_response(json.dumps('Successfully disconnected.'), 200)
         response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
         return response
 ```

 If I got any other response back from Google besides the `200`, then I assume something went wrong in the disconnect process. And return a `400` message to the client with a statement of what happened:
 ```
     else:
        response = make_response(json.dumps('Failed to revoke token for given user.', 400))
        response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
        return response
 ```
Now, when I visit the `/gdisconnect` URL, my user successfully logged out of my application.
