# Authorization

If authentication asks 'are you the person you claim to be', authorization deals with the issue of 'do you have the right to the resource you are trying to access?'. When you're trying to gain access to an exclusive or restricted area, having the right kind of authorization is what will get you past the door. Even if you can effectively verify you are who you claim to be, sometimes that just isn't enough if you aren't on the VIP list.

So being authorized means that you have been granted the right to do something, but in the context of user login systems, authorization can also be used to authorize some third party to do things in your name or have access to some part of your data.

And this is what happens when you use third party auth providers like Google+ or Facebook. The first time you log in, they will ask if you want to grant the initial website access to some of your data, like unique ID or email address.

The same principal applies to mobile apps. When you install them, they ask for permission to use certain phone functions, and you can then either allow the installation to proceed or not.

Another example of authorization is the access control in an operating system. Even after you're authenticated and logged in, you cannot do everything. There are certain things that require passing additional authorization checks. Authorization is what can allow users into an application, while still protecting its most valuable assets.
