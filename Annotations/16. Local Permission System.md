So you now have a web application that protects modifications from being made by people who aren't users. But what's protecting users from having their data modified by other users? In this lesson you're going to learn to implement local permissions and protect pages based on each user, and not just by the fact that they're logged in.

----

# Local Permission System

Let's create a local permission system that leverages the information stored in a `login_session` object, and uses server side logic in the database to control the user experience based on provided credentials.

In order to implement this local permission system, our database has to start storing information in a more user specific manner.

We need a table of users, so we can identify what data belongs to whom. Our restaurant and menu items tables should also be aware of their creators for each entry, so a `user_id` column should be added to both the restaurant and menu items tables. And finally, a little backing code to hook everything together on *project.py*.

So let's get started.

## Updating the User Model
The first thing I want you to do in order to add a local permission system is to create a user table in your database.

|<td colspan=2 style='text-align:center'>**User**|
|:----------------:|
|<td colspan=1>name <td colspan=1>*string*|
|<td colspan=1>email <td colspan=1>*string*|
|<td colspan=1>picture <td colspan=1>*string*|
|<td colspan=1>id <td colspan=1>*integer*|

We could store a lot more user information in this table, but for the sake of simplicity it should have a layout similar to this.

Also, we should modify the Restaurant and Menu Item models, such that they have user_id as foreign key relationships.

|<td colspan=2 style='text-align:center'>**Restaurant**|
|:----------------:|
|<td colspan=1>name <td colspan=1>*string*|
|<td colspan=1>id <td colspan=1>*integer*|
|<td colspan=1>user_id <td colspan=1>*integer*|
|<td colspan=2 style='text-align:center'>relationship|

|<td colspan=2 style='text-align:center'>**Menu Item**|
|:----------------:|
|<td colspan=1>name <td colspan=1>*string*|
|<td colspan=1>description <td colspan=1>*string*|
|<td colspan=1>price <td colspan=1>*string*|
|<td colspan=1>course <td colspan=1>*string*|
|<td colspan=1>id <td colspan=1>*integer*|
|<td colspan=1>restaurant_id <td colspan=1>*integer*|
|<td colspan=1>user_id <td colspan=1>*integer*|
|<td colspan=2 style='text-align:center'>relationship|
|<td colspan=2 style='text-align:center'>relationship|

## Quiz 1 - Updating the User Model

Look at the code for the Restaurant and Menu Items classes in the *database_setup.py* file and see if you can figure out how to add these modifications.

### Solution
I've created a new `User` class, like so:
```
class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'user'

    name = Column(String(250), nullable=False)
    email = Column(String(250), nullable=False)
    picture = Column(String(250))
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
```
... similarly to the `Restaurant` and `Menu Item` classes.

For `Restaurant` and `Menu Item` classes there's now a `user_id` variable and the relationship declaration to establish a ForeignKey relationship between these items and the user that created them:
```
class Restaurant(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'restaurant'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String(250), nullable=False)
    user_id = Column(Integer,ForeignKey('user.id'))
    user = relationship(User)
```
```
class MenuItem(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'menu_item'


    name =Column(String(80), nullable = False)
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key = True)
    description = Column(String(250))
    price = Column(String(8))
    course = Column(String(250))
    restaurant_id = Column(Integer,ForeignKey('restaurant.id'))
    restaurant = relationship(Restaurant)
    user_id = Column(Integer,ForeignKey('user.id'))
    user = relationship(User)
```

I'll rein in the database output in the `create_engine` to `restaurantmenuwithusers.db`, so we don't override our old database just yet.
```
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///restaurantmenuwithusers.db')
```
You can go ahead and run *database_setup.py* and it will create a new database complete with our user functionality. There's a new lotsofmenus.py **[here](https://github.com/udacity/ud330/blob/master/Lesson3/step2Quiz/lotsofmenus.py)** that will repopulate the database and set the user ID for all the restaurants equal to 1. Go ahead and run this as well. The complete version of the code for this quiz is available **[here](https://github.com/udacity/ud330/blob/master/Lesson3/step2Quiz/database_setup.py)**.

## Creating a New User

Now that we have a database that supports creating users, let's write up some codes to interact with it. For this project, I want to point out that our back end code will look up a user based on his or her email address associated with their login. So logging in with a Google account and a Facebook account tied to same email address will provide the same level of authorization.

To get started, open up your *project.py* file and be sure to import the `User` model that we just created.
```
from database_setup import Base, Restaurant, MenuItem, User
```

I want to walk you through three methods you should add to your *project.py* file that may help you deal with getting user information. The first is `createUser`:

```
def createUser(login_session):
    newUser = User(name = login_session['username'], email= login_session['email'], picture = login_session['picture'])
    session.add(newUser)
    session.commit()
    user = session.query(User).filter_by(email= login_session['email']).one()
    return user.id
```
* It takes in a `login_session` as input and creates a new user in our database extracting all of the fields necessary to populate it with information gathered from the `login_session`.
* It then returns a `user.id` of the new user created.

The next one is `getUserInfo`:
```
def getUserInfo(user_id):
    user = session.query(User).filter_by(id = user_id).one()
    return user
```
* If a `user_id` is passed into the method, it simply returns the user object associated with this ID number.

And finally, is `getUserID`:
```
def getUserID(email):
    try:
        user = session.query(User).filter_by(email = email).one()
        return user.id
    except:
        return None
```
* It takes an `email` address and returns an ID number if that email address belongs to a user stored in our database. If not, it returns `None`.

In your code, you should also add the `user_id` field when you create a new restaurant or menu item, like so:
```
def newRestaurant():
    ...

    if request.method == 'POST':
        newRestaurant = Restaurant(name = request.form['name'], user_id=login_session['user_id'])
        ...
    ...
```
```
def newMenuItem(restaurant_id):
    ...

    if request.method == 'POST':
        newItem = MenuItem(name = request.form['name'], description = request.form['description'], price = request.form['price'], course = request.form['course'], restaurant_id = restaurant_id, user_id=login_session['user_id'])
        ...
    ...
```
You can view these helper functions on line 132 of project.py **[here](https://github.com/udacity/ud330/blob/master/Lesson3/step2Quiz/project.py)**.

## Quiz 2 - Obtaining credentials of an existing user

Now I want you to add some functionality inside our `gconnect` method. When a user logs in with her Gmail account, we are going to see if her email address is already in the database. If not, then we make a new user account for her locally. After either making a new account, or retrieving an existing one, we store her user ID in the `login_session`. Use any combination of the three new functions presented in this lesson to help you complete this task.

### Solution

Let's run `getUserID` on the email address stored in our `login_session` and store it in a variable called `user_id`.
```
user_id = getUserID(login_session['email'])
```
If `user_id` doesn't have a value, then we can go ahead and create a new user and pass in the `login_session`:
```
if not user_id:
    user_id = createUser(login_session)
```
Then we take the result of that answer and store it in our `login_session` under `user_id`:
```
if not user_id:
    user_id = createUser(login_session)
login_session['user_id'] = user_id
```

## Quiz 3 - Protect Menu Pages

I've added some public templates for when a user is not the owner of a restaurant or menu page **[here](https://github.com/udacity/ud330/blob/master/Lesson3/step3/templates/publicmenu.html)** and **[here](https://github.com/udacity/ud330/blob/master/Lesson3/step3/templates/publicrestaurants.html)**.

These templates do not contain options to Add, Edit and Delete. Add code to your *project.py* that checks whether a user is the owner of a restaurant or menu item.

If they're the owner, render the original template. If not, render the public page.

Also, make sure that the Create, Edit and Delete functions always check to make sure the owner is the one issuing these commands before executing, in case the user tries to visit one of these pages via the URL.

### Solution
For `showRestaurant()`, I'm only going to differentiate whether a user is logged in or not logged in, since the only option on this page is to create a new restaurant. So using the same logic to see if there's a username value inside the `login_session`, I'll render one template or the other:
```
def showRestaurants():
    restaurants = session.query(Restaurant).order_by(asc(Restaurant.name))
    if 'username' not in login_session:
        return render_template('publicrestaurants.html', restaurants = restaurants)
    else:
        return render_template('restaurants.html', restaurants = restaurants)
```

For the `showMenuItem()` it's a little bit more complex, since now I need to protect each menu, based on whoever created it.

So if the user isn't logged in, or isn't the original creator, let's render the public menu:
```
def showMenu(restaurant_id):
    restaurant = session.query(Restaurant).filter_by(id = restaurant_id).one()
    creator = getUserInfo(restaurant.user_id)
    items = session.query(MenuItem).filter_by(restaurant_id = restaurant_id).all()
    if 'username' not in login_session or creator.id != login_session['user_id']:
        return render_template('publicmenu.html', items=items, restaurant=restaurant, creator=creator)
    else:
        return render_template('menu.html', items = items, restaurant = restaurant, creator=creator)
```
* Otherwise, they are logged in and are the creator, so we can go ahead and render the original *menu.html*.

I also added alert messages to protect my `create`, `edit` and `delete` functions, just in case the user tries to visit a url that they aren't authorized to access.
#### newMenuItem:
```
def newMenuItem(restaurant_id):
    if 'username' not in login_session:
        return redirect('/login')
    restaurant = session.query(Restaurant).filter_by(id=restaurant_id).one()
    if login_session['user_id'] != restaurant.user_id:
        return "<script>function myFunction() {alert('You are not authorized to add menu items to this restaurant. Please create your own restaurant in order to add items.');}</script><body onload='myFunction()'>"
    ...
```
#### deleteMenuItem:
```
def deleteMenuItem(restaurant_id, menu_id):
    if 'username' not in login_session:
        return redirect('/login')
    restaurant = session.query(Restaurant).filter_by(id=restaurant_id).one()
    itemToDelete = session.query(MenuItem).filter_by(id=menu_id).one()
    if login_session['user_id'] != restaurant.user_id:
        return "<script>function myFunction() {alert('You are not authorized to delete menu items to this restaurant. Please create your own restaurant in order to delete items.');}</script><body onload='myFunction()'>"
    ...
```
#### editMenuItem
```
def editMenuItem(restaurant_id, menu_id):
    if 'username' not in login_session:
        return redirect('/login')
    editedItem = session.query(MenuItem).filter_by(id=menu_id).one()
    restaurant = session.query(Restaurant).filter_by(id=restaurant_id).one()
    if login_session['user_id'] != restaurant.user_id:
        return "<script>function myFunction() {alert('You are not authorized to edit menu items to this restaurant. Please create your own restaurant in order to edit items.');}</script><body onload='myFunction()'>"
    ...
```
#### editRestaurant
```
def editRestaurant(restaurant_id):
    editedRestaurant = session.query(
        Restaurant).filter_by(id=restaurant_id).one()
    if 'username' not in login_session:
        return redirect('/login')
    if editedRestaurant.user_id != login_session['user_id']:
        return "<script>function myFunction() {alert('You are not authorized to edit this restaurant. Please create your own restaurant in order to edit.');}</script><body onload='myFunction()'>"
    ...
```
#### deleteRestaurant
```
def deleteRestaurant(restaurant_id):
    restaurantToDelete = session.query(Restaurant).filter_by(id = restaurant_id).one()
    if 'username' not in login_session:
        return redirect('/login')
    if restaurantToDelete.user_id != login_session['user_id']:
        return "<script>function myFunction() {alert('You are not authorized to delete this restaurant. Please create your own restaurant in order to delete.');}</script><body onload='myFunction()'>"
    ...
```

## Wrap-Up

Using OAuth2, you have secured your restaurant menu application and created local authorization to user specific resources. But this application should offer alternative login options for users who don't have a Google+ account. Let's dive into lesson 4 and see how we can accomodate for this. **[Next](17. Adding Additional OAuth Providers.md)**
