# GConnect

On the server side, I must create a function that handles the code sent back from the callback method. But before I can do that, I need to import a few libraries in my *project.py* file that will be necessary for this function.
```
from oauth2client.client import flow_from_clientsecrets
from oauth2client.client import FlowExchangeError
import httplib2
import json
from flask import make_response
```
* The `flow_from_clientsecrets` method creates a flow object from the *client_secret.json* file. This JSON formatted style stores your client ID, client secret and other OAuth 2.0 parameters.

* If we run into an error trying to exchange an authorization code for an access token, we can catch it with `FlowExchangeError`.

* We will also use the `httplib2`, a comprehensive HTTP client library in Python.

* The `json` module provides an API for converting in memory Python objects to serialized representation known as JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation.

* The `make_response` method converts the return value from a function into a real response object that we can send off to our client.

* And `requests` is an Apache 2.0 licensed HTTP library written in Python, similar to `urllib2` but with a few improvements.

Now, going back to the **[console.developers.google.com](https://console.developers.google.com)** page and opening the **Credentials** menu. I will click the Download JSON object, rename this file to *client_secret.json* and store it in the same directory as my *project.py* file. I will then declare my `CLIENT_ID` by referencing this *client_secret.json* file.
```
CLIENT_ID = json.loads(
    open('client_secret.json', 'r').read())['web']['client_id']
```
Now I'm ready to create my server-side function.

I will make a route and function that accepts `POST` requests, and call it `gconnect`, like so:
```
@app.route('/gconnect', methods=['POST'])
def gconnect():
```
I now confirm that the token that the client sends to the server matches the token that the server sent to the client. This round trip verification helps ensure that the user is making the request, and not a malicious script:
```
def gconnect():
    if requests.args.get('state') != login_session['state']:
        response = make_response(json.dumps('Invalid state parameter.'), 401)
        response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
        return response
```
* Using the `request.args.get` method, my code examines the `state` token passed in and compares it to the `state` of the `login_session`.  If these two do not match, then I create a response of an invalid `state` token and return a message to the client. No further authentication will occur on the server side if there's a mismatch between the state tokens.

* If this statement is not true, then I can proceed and collect the one time code from my server with the `request.data` function:

    ```
    def gconnect():
        if requests.args.get('state') != login_session['state']:
            response = make_response(json.dumps('Invalid state parameter.'), 401)
            response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
            return response
        code = request.data
    ```

Next, I will try and use this one-time code and exchange it for a credentials object which will contain the access token for my server.
```
try:
    # Upgrade the authorization code into a credentials object

    oauth_flow = flow_from_clientsecrets('client_secret.json', scope='')
    oauth_flow.redirect_uri = 'postmessage'
    credentials = oauth_flow.step2_exchange(code)
```
* This creates an `oauth_flow` object and adds my client's secret key information to it.

* Then, I specify with `postmessage` that this is the one-time code flow my server will be sending off.

* Finally, I initiate the exchange with the `step2_exchange` function, passing in my one-time code as input. This `step2_exchange` function of the flow class exchanges an authorization `code` for a credentials object. If all goes well, then the response from Google will be an object I am storing under the name `credentials`.

If an error happens along the way, then I will throw this flow exchange error and send the response as a JSON object:
```
except FlowExchangeError:
    response = make_response(json.dumps('Failed to upgrade the authorization code.'), 401)
    response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
    return response
```

Now that I have this credentials object, I will check and see if there's a valid access token inside of it.

I will store `credentials.access_token` in a variable called `access_token`. If I append this token to this following Google URL, like so: `https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/tokeninfo?access_token=%s' % access_token`, the Google API server can verify that this is a valid token for use.
```
# Check that the access token is valid.

access_token = credentials.access_token
url = ('https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/tokeninfo?access_token=%s' % access_token)
```
In these next two lines of code, I create a json `GET` request containing the URL and access token:
```
h = httplib2.Http()
result = json.loads(h.request(url, 'GET')[1])
```
I store the results of this request in a variable called `result`. If my result contains any errors, then I send a `500` Internal Server Error to my client.
```
# If there was an error in the access token info, abort.

if result.get('error') is not None:
    response = make_response(json.dumps(result.get('error')), 500)
    response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
    return response
```
If this `if` statement isn't true, then we know that we have a working access token. But now let's make sure that we have the right access token.
```
# Verify that the access token is used for the intended user.

gplus_id = credentials.id_token['sub']
if result['user_id'] != gplus_id:
    response = make_response(
        json.dumps("Token's user ID doesn't match given user ID."), 401)
    response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
    return response
```
* Here I grab the ID of the token in my credentials object and compare it to the ID returned by the Google API server. If these two IDs do not match, then I do not have the correct token and should return an error.

Similarly, if the client IDs do not match, my app is trying to use a client ID that does not belong to it, so I shouldn't allow for this. Like so:
```
# Verify that the access token is valid for this app.

if result['issued_to'] != CLIENT_ID:
    response = make_response(
        json.dumps("Token's client ID does not match app's."), 401)
    print "Token's client ID does not match app's."
    response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
    return response
```
Lastly, I will check if the user is already logged into the system. This will return a `200` successful authentication without resetting all of the login session variables again.
```
# Check to see if user is already logged in

stored_access_token = login_session.get('access_token')
stored_gplus_id = login_session.get('gplus_id')

if stored_access_token is not None and gplus_id == stored_gplus_id:
    response = make_response(json.dumps('Current user is already connected.'),200)
    response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
    return response
```

So assuming none of these if statements were true, I have a valid access token and my user's successfully able to log into my server.

In this user's `login_session` I will store their credentials in Google Plus ID:
```
# Store the access token in the session for later use.

login_session['access_token'] = credentials.access_token
login_session['gplus_id'] = gplus_id
```
Next, I will use the Google Plus API to get some more information about the user:
```
# Get user info

    userinfo_url = "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/userinfo"
    params = {'access_token': credentials.access_token, 'alt': 'json'}
    answer = requests.get(userinfo_url, params=params)

    data = answer.json()
```
* Here, I will send off a message to the Google API server with my access token, requesting the user info allowed by my token scope and store in an object I will call Data.

Now, data should have all of these values filled in...
```
{
    "kind": "plus#personOpenIdConnect",
    "gender": string,
    "sub": string,
    "name": string,
    "given_name": string,
    "family_name": string,
    "profile": string,
    "email": string,
    "email_verified": "true",
    "locale": string,
    "hd": string
}
```
... so long as the user specified them in their account.

So I will store the ones I am interested in, such as the user's name, picture, and e-mail address, and store them in my `login_session`:
```
login_session['username'] = data['name']
login_session['picture'] = data['picture']
login_session['email'] = data['email']
```
If this worked, then I should be able to create a response that knows the user's name and can return their picture. I can even add a flash message to let the user know that they are logged in, like so:
```
output = ''
output += '<h1>Welcome, '
output += login_session['username']
output += '!</h1>'
output += '<img src="'
output += login_session['picture']
output += ' " style = "width: 300px; height: 300px;border-radius: 150px;-webkit-border-radius: 150px;-moz-border-radius: 150px;"> '
flash("you are now logged in as %s" % login_session['username'])
print "done!"
return output
```
Let's save our changes and try logging in again.

### :warning: IMPORTANT

Depending on the version of Flask you have, you may or may not be able to store a credentials object in the `login_session` the same way. You may get the following error:

```
OAuth2Credentials object is not JSON serializable
```

What should you do to fix this? There are three options:

1. Rather than storing the entire `credentials` object you can store just the access token instead. It can be accessed using `credentials.access_token`.

2. The OAuth2Credentials class comes with methods that can help you. The `.to_json()` and `.from_json()` methods can help you store and retrieve the credentials object in json format.

3. Update your versions of Flask. Use the following commands:
    ```
    pip install werkzeug==0.8.3
    pip install flask==0.9
    pip install Flask-Login==0.1.3
    ```

**Note:** If you get a permissions error, you will need to include `sudo` at the beginning of each command. That should look like this:
```
sudo pip install flask==0.9
```

Go to the GoogleDevConsole > API & Auth > Credentials > Select your app > Authorized Redirect URIs and add the following URIs: http://localhost:5000/login and http://localhost:5000/gconnect. You may have to change the port number depending on the port number you have set your app to run on.
