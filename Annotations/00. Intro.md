# Intro to Authentication and Authorization

In this class we'll learn to add security features to our applications, allowing users to log in on your site using OAuth2 providers.

By the end of this course you'll not only have understanding on how to securely implement log ins and permission systems, but also have a basic understanding of how web security works and some potential things to look out for when exchanging sensitive information across the web.

To accomplish this goal you'll be provided a restaurant menu application. If you completed the full stack foundations course, you've already created a version of this application.

You will make the app secure by restricting access to unauthenticated users. This means that you'll be able to share it safely with the world as part of your portfolio.

You will also have the knowledge and hands-on experience to implement similar systems on your future sites.

In order to get the most out of this course, you should be familiar with Python and the Flask web development framework. A basic understanding of JavaScript and using jQuery to make Ajax calls will also be needed for this course.

We will be using Google+ and Facebook sign ins for this class. So that means you'll need accounts on both of these sites in order to do the exercises. If you don't have these accounts, set them up.

# Course Map

## Lesson 1

In the first lesson of this course we will discuss some of the basic concepts of web security, including the difference between authentication and authorization, and some of the related security concerns that they address. You will also learn the necessary flow of information for OAuth security and play with some of Google's OAuth features in the Google OAuth2 playground.

## Lesson 2

In lesson 2 we will go more in depth on the different types of OAuth2 options for clients and servers, implement logins and logouts, and secure our menu pages for authenticated users using Google Plus sign-in.

## Lesson 3

In the 3rd lesson, we will create a local permission system, protecting the data of each user from being modified by other users.

## Lesson 4

And in lesson 4, we will explore other OAuth2 providers, such as Facebook and GitHub to allow multiple sign in options for our users.

To better understand what you will be learning, I would like to point out a few similar topics that will be outside the scope of this course. Cybersecurity and cryptography are very complex topics that form the foundation of web security.

OAuth handles a lot of this complexity for us. Therefore, this course will focus on implementation more so than the mathematics and theory behind this technology.

In a bit, we will see some of the challenges of implementing your own web security to better advocate the use of trusted frameworks like OAuth.

In this course you'll leverage existing OAuth2 providers such as GitHub and Google to allow users to securely sign in to your web applications. But we will not cover creating your own OAuth2 server.
